 # 🔎 NetScan-C – Multi-threaded Port Scanner in C

 ## 👨‍💻 Author : Roy Meoded


**NetScan-C** is a multi-threaded TCP port scanner written in C.  
It scans a range of ports on a given IP address, detects which are open, and optionally prints banner information from open services.
  

##  Features

- Scan a custom IP address over a specified port range
- Identify open, closed, or unresponsive ports
- Grab service banners from open ports
- Display results in terminal and export to HTML (`report.html`)
- Parallel scanning using `select()` for efficiency


## Project Structure

- `scanner.c` – Main file that handles CLI arguments and runs the scan loop
- `port_utils.c` – Functions for checking if a port is open
- `services.c` – Maps known port numbers to their service names
- `parallel_scan.c` – Handles multi-threaded scanning using select
- `banner.c` – Contains logic to grab banner information from open ports


## 📝 HTML Report 

The project includes a basic HTML file (`report.html`) that can be extended to display scan results in a user-friendly webpage.  
Currently, it can serve as:
- A placeholder for exported scan summaries
- A base for building a GUI in the browser
- An integration target for future web-based visualization
